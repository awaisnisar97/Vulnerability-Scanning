First, I set up a Windows 10 sandbox environment using VMware<br/>

<br />
While setting up my virtual environment, I installed the Nessus software and successfully went through the installation process.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 After both installations, I proceeded to scan the Windows sandbox to identify vulnerabilities on the endpoint. The scan returned eighteen vulnerabilities with one "Medium" severity and a CVSS of 5.3. Other vulnerabilities in providing information were also looked at and taken notice of.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 I proceeded to conduct a more in-depth scanning through Credential scanning. With this, I had to grant permission to the sandbox environment to connect remotely. I did this by enabling the Remote Registry to be automatic, turning on the advanced sharing setting and creating a LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy to grant access as directed by Nesus documentation for connecting remotely with users on a different network. I then restarted the computer for the new setting to take effect. <br/>

<br />  
I configured the Credential scanning on my pc by validating it with the credentials of the sandbox OS and running the scan. It took quite some time to scan, s it returned more high-severity vulnerabilities.<br />

<br />
<br />
 Additionally, an old version of Firefox version was also installed on the sandbox to perform scanning tests.<br/>

<br />
<br />
The results returned had more critical vulnerabilities that required immediate attention. The remedies for the vulnerabilities were to apply an update to the system.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 The sandbox system was updated, and the main critical issue was the deprecated Firefox. It was realised that most vulnerabilities identified after the update were for informational purposes. <br/>
