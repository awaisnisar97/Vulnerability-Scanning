First, I set up a Windows 10 sandbox environment using VMware Oracle <br/>

<br />
<br />
While setting up my virtual environment, I installed the Nessus software and successfully went through the installation process.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 Following the installation of both programs, I conducted a scan on the Windows sandbox to pinpoint vulnerabilities present on the endpoint. The scan uncovered a total of seventeen vulnerabilities, among which one was categorized as "Medium" severity, possessing a CVSS score of 5.3. Additionally, I thoroughly examined and duly noted other vulnerabilities pertaining to information disclosure .<br/>

<br />
<br />
 I undertook a thorough scan utilising Credential scanning, necessitating permission to be granted to the sandbox environment for remote connectivity. This was facilitated by enabling the Remote Registry to operate automatically, activating advanced sharing settings, and establishing a LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy to authorise access, in accordance with the guidance outlined in the Nessus documentation for remote connectivity with users on disparate networks. Subsequently, the computer was restarted to implement the new settings.<br/>

<br />  
 I configured Credential scanning on my PC by authenticating it with the credentials of the sandbox OS and initiated the scan. The scanning process was time-consuming, but it yielded a higher number of high-severity vulnerabilities.<br />

<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, an outdated version of Firefox was installed on the sandbox environment for conducting scanning tests.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 The results revealed a higher number of critical vulnerabilities that demanded prompt attention. The necessary remedy for these vulnerabilities involved applying updates to the system.<br/>

<br />
<br />
 Following the update of the sandbox system, the primary critical issue identified was the deprecated version of Firefox. Subsequently, it became apparent that the majority of vulnerabilities identified post-update were merely for informational purposes. <br/>
